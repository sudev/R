## We will talk about 

- Mean 
- Median 
- Variance 
- Standard Deviation 
- Correlation 
- Associative Analysis 
- A tutorial on [boxplots](http://msenux.redwoods.edu/math/R/boxplot.php), amazing stuff.

# Measure of location 
- **Mean** - is the average of the datapoints 
- **Median** - is the 50th percentile.     
[Calculating median](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StatisticalMedian.html)         
  *Note* - [Percentile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) is different from percentage.
- Terminology 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartiles are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles respectively.

# Measure of Spread

- (Variance) = sum(  x - mean ) / (n - 1)
- standard deviation = sqrt(variance)

Standard deviation is the average distance from the mean value.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 10, 22, 43, 18)
mean(x)
median(x)
sd(x)
```

### Measure of Association

- Correlation 
- [Dont know correlation ?](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/correlation.html)




<br /> 
<br />

<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 


```{r}
# Creating a sample correlated X and Y vectors 
x <- 1:10 
y <- (x+x) + 15
cor(x,y)
plot(x, y)


# runif function generates random numbers
# Correlation for random sample vectors X and Y
x <- runif(100)
y <- runif(100)
cor(x,y)
plot(x, y)
```

- The correlation measure helps you decide the features for Kmeans sort of algorithms.


## Association Analysis

```{r}
# Entering the values 
customer_id <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5)
trans_id <- c(0001, 0024, 0012, 0031, 0015, 0022, 0029, 0040, 0033, 0038)
items_bought <- list( c("a", "d", "e"), c("a","b","c","e"), c("a","b","d","e"), c("a","c","d","e"), c("b","c","e"), c("b","d","e"), c("c","d"), c("a", "b", "C"), c("a", "d", "e"), c("a","b","c"))

# creating a named list for support and confidence 
support = list()
confidence = list()
for (item in c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
{ 
  count = 0 
  for (i in 1:length(items_bought)){ 
   if ( item %in% items_bought[[i]] ) {
     count = count + 1 
    }
  }
  support[item] = count 
}
support
confidence <- sapply(support, function(x){ as.numeric(x[[1]] / 10) })
confidence
```

Solution: 

Q1. The confidence for associative rule `{b, d} ->  {a}`      


  S(a) = 7 / 10       
  s(b, d) = 2 / 10      
  s(a, b, d) = 1 / 10 
  s((b,d) -> (a)) = 1 / 10
  
  C((b,d) -> (a) = S(a, b, d) / S(b, d) = (1 / 10) / (2 / 10) = 0.5
  
Q2. The confidence for associative rule `{a} -> {b, d}`    
  Similarly,         
  S(a -> (b,d)) = 1 / 10       
  C(a -> (b, d)) = 1/ 7 = 0.14 


- Support indicates the frequency/probability at which the event has occured, i.e. S((b, d) -> a) implies the probable sale of (a,b,d) in a basket.
- Confidence implies the probability for someone to buy item `a` along with `(b, c)`
- So, it implies in a basket of {b, d}, we will find {a} half the times.

**Note** : Here we did all the analysis treating each transaction as a basket, we can also treat  each customers as baskets ( i.e to club all the transaction of a customer and make it a basket). Try doing the same problem considering each customer as a basket.
