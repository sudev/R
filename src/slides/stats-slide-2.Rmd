### Factors

One important use of attributes is to define factors. A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. Factors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes: the `class()`, "factor", which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and the `levels()`, which defines the set of allowed values.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
class(x)
levels(x)

# You can't use values that are not in the levels
x[2] <- "c"
x

# NB: you can't combine factors
c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
```

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take, even if you don't see all values in a given dataset. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:

```{r}
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))

table(sex_char)
table(sex_factor)
```

Sometimes when a data frame is read directly from a file, a column you'd thought would produce a numeric vector instead produces a factor. This is caused by a non-numeric value in the column, often a missing value encoded in a special way like `.` or `-`. To remedy the situation, coerce the vector from a factor to a character vector, and then from a character to a double vector. (Be sure to check for missing values after this process.) Of course, a much better plan is to discover what caused the problem in the first place and fix that; using the `na.strings` argument to `read.csv()` is often a good place to start.

```{r}
# Reading in "text" instead of from a file here:
z <- read.csv(text = "value\n12\n1\n.\n9")
z
typeof(z$value)
as.double(z$value)
# Oops, that's not right: 3 2 1 4 are the levels of a factor, 
# not the values we read in!
class(z$value)
# We can fix it now:
as.double(as.character(z$value))
# Or change how we read it in:
z <- read.csv(text = "value\n12\n1\n.\n9", na.strings=".")
typeof(z$value)
class(z$value)
z$value
# Perfect! :)
```

I have reproduced the relevant R discussed in slide-2 here as snippets. The course websites weblog is available at ` `, we will also use the same data to perform some analysis in R.  

Reading data into R, 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/sudev.ac/Desktop/Everything Else/R/assets/stats202log.txt", sep = " ", header = F)
```


Subsetting 

indexing is as `Row, Coloumn` 

To get the row, 
```{r}
data[1,]
```

To get first five rows,

```{r}
data[1:5,]
```

First coloumn 
```{r}
# To get first coloumn you should use 
# data[ , 1]

# I have subsetted the first coloumn to show only 10 elements, the syntaxt to get entire first coloumn is data[ , 1]
data[ , 1][1:10]
is.factor(data[,1])
```

Sometimes `read.csv()` wont give the desired result.
```{r}
data[,8][1:10]
is.factor(data[,8])

# but it should be a  numberic field 
```

This issue is due to not telling `read.csv()` that `-` should be considered as `NA` or missing value.
```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/sudev.ac/Desktop/Everything Else/R/assets/stats202log.txt", sep = " ", header = F, na.strings="-")
is.numeric(data[,8])
```

### Let me show you something here

Till now its been boring numbers, say if we wanted to see the page which got max number of hit from this log and tabulate that.
As you can see the GET request indicates the visisted/requested page.
```{r}
data[, 6][1:5]
```
Now, lets get the URI out of the `GET` requesst string. Using function `strsplit` you can split character vectors with any specified split character.

```{r}
# In this log the split character is space.
newList <- strsplit(as.character(data[,6]), split = " ")
# Now we have a list of list.
newList[1:3]
```
 Its hard to tabulate when its a list. `Unlist` function will flatten a list. 
 
```{r}
newList <- unlist(newList)
newList[1:10]

```
Now we will index out every third element starting from position 2, so as to get the links.
```{r}
links <- newList[seq(2, length(newList), by =3)]
# sample element in links 
links[1:10]
# Table function creates a table with [value, frequency] pair
table(links)
```
